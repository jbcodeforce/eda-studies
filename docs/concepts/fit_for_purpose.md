## Fit for Purpose

In this note, we'll outline some of the key criteria to consider and assess during the establishment and ongoing governance of an event-driven architecture (EDA).

While not an exhaustive list, these criteria provide a solid foundation for analysis and evaluation:

1. **Business Alignment:** Ensure the EDA aligns with the organization's strategic objectives and can effectively support the required business capabilities and use cases.
1. **Architectural Patterns:** Evaluate the appropriate architectural patterns and design principles to be applied, such as publish-subscribe, event sourcing, or CQRS, based on the specific requirements.
1. **Technology Selection:** Assess the suitability of various event-driven technologies, messaging platforms, and stream processing tools to meet the performance, scalability, and integration needs.
1. **Data Governance:** Establish robust data governance practices to manage data models, data lineage, and the flow of events across the EDA ecosystem.
1. **Operational Resilience:** Evaluate the reliability, fault-tolerance, and disaster recovery capabilities of the EDA to ensure high availability and minimize disruptions.
1. **Developer Experience:** Consider the ease of use, developer productivity, and overall experience in building and maintaining event-driven applications.
